    <img src="/media/cream-penguins.png" alt="An image of cream cheese penguins" height="300" width="300">
    <p>These adorable cream cheese penguins are the perfect appetizer for any party or gathering. Made with black olives, carrots, and cream cheese, they can be dressed up with scarves and hats made from red pepper strips or pimentos. Frilly toothpicks add a fun touch to these cute little treats!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Jumbo black olives:</strong> 18 pitted jumbo black olives to create the penguin body.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream cheese:</strong> One 8-ounce package of softened cream cheese to fill the olives.</li>
        <li><strong>Small black olives:</strong> 18 small black olives for the penguin heads.</li>
        <li><strong>Carrot:</strong> One carrot, sliced into 18 1/4-inch-thick rounds, to form the penguin feet.</li>
        <li><strong>Red pepper strips or pimentos:</strong> Optional, to make scarves and hats for the penguins.</li>
        <li><strong>Frilly toothpicks:</strong> Optional, for an extra fun touch to secure the penguins together.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut a slit lengthwise into each jumbo olive and fill with about 1 teaspoon of cream cheese.</li>
        <li>Slice the carrot into rounds and cut a small notch out of each slice to form feet. Save the cut-out pieces for the beaks.</li>
        <li>Press the cut-out carrot pieces into the centers of the small olives to form beaks. If necessary, make a small slit in the small olives to insert the beaks.</li>
        <li>Place a jumbo olive (large hole side down) onto a carrot slice and set a small olive on top, aligning the beak, cream cheese chest, and notch in the carrot slice. Secure with a toothpick.</li>
        <li>Optional: Add scarves and hats by cutting strips of red pepper or pimentos and placing them on the penguins. For an extra touch, use frilly toothpicks to hold everything together.</li>
